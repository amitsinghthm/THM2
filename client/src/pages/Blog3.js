          What Causes Poor Mental Health at Work?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          Almost half of adults experience a mental health issue in their
          lifetime.2 Of the employees surveyed, 57.9 percent say work had at
          least a moderate impact on their mental health.2
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          There are many ways a work environment can contribute towards poor
          mental health at work. Excessive stress and frustration due to toxic
          relationships, inexperienced leadership, and unclear communication can
          build up over time. Layer this with a lack of clear roles and
          expectations, long or inflexible work schedules, unrealistic demands,
          and lack of support for employees and it's no surprise a worker can
          feel unsatisfied, depressed, and exhausted. Other factors can compound
          the issue, such as:

          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
              Too many unpleasant or repetitive tasks
            </li>
            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">No sense of teamwork</li>
            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
              Being subjected to discrimination
            </li>
            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
              Watching favoritism play out with coworkers

            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Harassment or bullying</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          Don't overlook the ripple effect of mental health at work as employees
          struggle to balance personal and work demands as well as growing
          financial pressures.

          Importance of Talking About Mental Health in the Workplace
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          Make no mistake, the success and longevity of a business rely on the
          collective, positive mental health of its workers. Positive mental
          health gives a person resiliency against life's stressors, challenges,
          and setbacks — obstacles that often go hand-in-hand with a job. Being
          fortified against the negative emotions and anxiety that accompany
          difficult times can help a person navigate with agility and remain
          productive.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          While the employers we surveyed said they are aware of the costs of
          mental health issues to their business, they may not be as aware of
          the extent of employees' mental health struggles.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          One reason may be that employees don't feel comfortable talking about
          their personal or mental health issues with superiors. More than half
          of respondents — 54% — said they felt uncomfortable talking to their
          supervisors about mental health.2 Some even feared that discussing it
          could lead to being fired or furloughed (30%) or cost them a promotion
          (29%). If employees did talk about their personal issues, they were
          most likely to confide in co-workers.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          When a manager or supervisor makes a habit of addressing the
          importance of mental health in the workplace, everyone benefits. A
          healthy state of mind can translate to higher levels of creativity
          along with a greater sense of self-worth and sense of happiness. These
          are prized attributes for nurturing high performance and strong
          corporate culture.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-2xl text-gray-900">
          Impact of Poor Employee Mental Health in the Workplace
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          Lost productivity, absenteeism, having to recruit and train employees
          due to high turnover, and even higher health insurance costs are all
          potentially related to poor employee mental health. Even for small
          businesses, these costs can add up.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          Business leaders say mental health issues can have a negative impact
          on their operations in the following ways:
        </p>

        <div class="p-6 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Revenue decreased (40%)</li>
            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Profitability decreased (39%)</li>
            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Loss of customers (30%)</li>
            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Diminished output (26%)</li>
            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Reduced competitiveness (20%)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          In fact, business leaders report that stress negatively affects their
          life outside of work, including reduced sleep, worsened work/life
          balance, and less time with the family.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          Given that mental health can have an impact on finances, productivity,
          and turnover, supervisors considered mental health when making
          business decisions. Over 35% of supervisors say they were extremely
          likely to consider their employees mental health when making
          decisions, with female supervisors being more likely than their male
          counterparts to do so.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2 text-2xl text-gray-900">
          Poor Relationships With Managers or Superiors
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          With the hierarchical structure of most businesses, managers and
          superiors typically hold sway over their employees, which can leave
          employees feeling anxious and vulnerable. For instance, an overbearing
          boss who micromanages every detail can leave workers feeling an
          absence of trust in their competence and ability to do their roles.
          Other times, managers may hold unrealistic expectations for deadlines,
          sales quotas, or deliverables.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          Working under an umbrella of constant stress will lead to strained
          relationships. Moreover, an over-tasked employee is at risk of being
          unable to meet expectations, including those of customers.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2 text-2xl text-gray-900">
          Workplace Errors & Poor Decision Making
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          Good decision making requires being able to focus on the issue at hand
          and weigh all possibilities. An employee burdened with mental health
          issues may be more likely to be distracted. Inability to focus on a
          task can increase the likelihood of making errors in the workplace
          ranging from inputting the wrong data into a computer, struggling to
          develop creative solutions to challenges, or failing to communicate in
          a timely fashion. Personal time management, project planning, and
          general control of the work environment may decline all of which can
          impact employee performance.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-2xl text-gray-900">Declining Company Revenue</p>

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          Revenue for any business is the cumulative result of many efforts.
          Innovation, attention to detail, and excellent service are just a few.
          Bottom line: strong employee mental health in the workplace fuels
          strong profits.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          When energy is spent on managing difficult relationships rather than
          producing creative ideas and being productive, a business loses the
          valuable employee contributions it needs to keep an edge over its
          competition. Customers can also sense when a worker is unhappy or
          stressed and may seek to take their business where they will be
          greeted with a genuine smile and customer service backed with
          employees who have ownership in the client relationship.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2 text-2xl text-gray-900">
          Low Morale & Increased Risk of Job Flight
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          Employees who are satisfied with their job and have strong social
          networks in the workplace tend to exhibit high loyalty. Conversely,
          when interactions with colleagues and supervisors are tense and the
          business's internal structure leaves little room for growth, low
          morale is likely. Unless action is taken to help an employee feel
          valued and cared for, they are at risk of leaving the business to
          search for a more suitable arrangement elsewhere.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2 text-2xl text-gray-900">
          Damaged Reputation & Negative Brand Association
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          In an age when customers value how a business treats its staff and
          don't hesitate to share their experiences on social media, it's likely
          that low employee morale will make itself known to consumers, clients,
          and the public at large. Employees and the work they do give a face
          and reputation to the business. An employer who does not pay attention
          to workers' mental health needs risks having its corporate brand
          associated with callousness and negativity. It's likely that an
          adverse impact on talent acquisition and sales will ensue.

          How Can Employers Support Mental Health in the Workplace?
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
          Supporting mental health in the workplace does not have to be
          expensive or complicated. There are many strategies that will nurture
          a culture of mental health and well-being.

              Offer a rich mix of benefits. Employers can help their workers
              feel less stressed about their health and their financial future
              with affordable health insurance, an employer-sponsored retirement
              plan, programs specifically dedicated to supporting employee
              mental health, and programs that offer financial fitness support.

              work/life balance.

              Check-ins with supervisors. Regular meetings may give supervisors
              the opportunity to gauge how the employee is feeling. Discussions
              can include issues the employee has, solutions available to them,
              and career paths to keep the employee engaged and working towards
              goals.
            </li>
            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
              A confidential online communication system. If a question or issue
              should arise, employees may contact their HR professional or
              supervisor online through an internal communication system. This
              can be a convenient, confidential way to keep leaders and
              employees connected. It can also allow the leader to respond
              quickly and take any necessary steps.
            </li>
            <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">
              Opportunities for enjoyment and enrichment. Consider including in
              your rich mix of benefits, other types of workplace perks. This
              can range from challenges or programs to improve physical and
              mental health to handwritten thank you cards acknowledging a job
              well done or appreciation of service during challenging times.

              An employee assistance program (EAP). Help your staff get the

              from finding childcare to fitness programs to counseling
              referrals. According to our 2023 Priorities for Business Leaders
              study, 19% of employers are extremely or very likely to start
              offering an EAP in the next 12 months.

          more vibrant, supportive workplace. Its a worthwhile investment for an
          employer to address the many ways a work environment can impact an
          employees health. A proactive approach can catch small problems before
          they escalate into something greater. Taking meaningful action to
          protect employees’ mental health is also a way to show your employees
