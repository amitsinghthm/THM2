        Work can protect mental health
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        Almost 60% of the world population is in work (1). All workers have the right to a safe and healthy environment at work. Decent work supports good mental health by providing:

       </ul>
     </div>
        
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        For people with mental health conditions, decent work can contribute to recovery and inclusion, improve confidence and social functioning.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        Safe and healthy working environments are not only a fundamental right but are also more likely to minimize tension and conflicts at work and improve staff retention, work performance and productivity. Conversely, a lack of effective structures and support at work, especially for those living with mental health conditions, can affect a person’s ability to enjoy their work and do their job well; it can undermine people’s attendance at work and even stop people getting a job in the first place.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        Employers can collaborate with mental health professionals to ensure the wellbeing of their employees. Regular counseling sessions covering a range of topics, including career discussions and stress management techniques, can be offered. Providing a safe space for employees to express their concerns and seek guidance is crucial. Additionally, incorporating preventive and curative interventions within the workplace, such as workshops on mindfulness and resilience, can empower employees to take charge of their mental health.

        Risks to mental health at work
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        At work, risks to mental health, also called psychosocial risks, may be related to job content or work schedule, specific characteristics of the workplace or opportunities for career development among other things.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        Risks to mental health at work can include:
        </p>
        <div class="p-6 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
     <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">under-use of skills or being under-skilled for work;</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">excessive workloads or work pace, understaffing;</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">long, unsocial or inflexible hours;</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">lack of control over job design or workload;</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">unsafe or poor physical working conditions;</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">organizational culture that enables negative behaviours;</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">limited support from colleagues or authoritarian supervision;</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">violence, harassment or bullying;</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">discrimination and exclusion;</li>

       </ul>
     </div>

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        More than half the global workforce works in the informal economy (2), where there is no regulatory protection for health and safety. These workers often operate in unsafe working environments, work long hours, have little or no access to social or financial protections and face discrimination, all of which can undermine mental health.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        Although psychosocial risks can be found in all sectors, some workers are more likely to be exposed to them than others, because of what they do or where and how they work. Health, humanitarian or emergency workers often have jobs that carry an elevated risk of exposure to adverse events, which can negatively impact mental health.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        Economic recessions or humanitarian and public health emergencies elicit risks such as job loss, financial instability, reduced employment opportunities or increased unemployment.

        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        People with severe mental health conditions are more likely to be excluded from employment, and when in employment, they are more likely to experience inequality at work. Being out of work also poses a risk to mental health. Unemployment, job and financial insecurity, and recent job loss are risk factors for suicide attempts.

        Government, employers, the organizations which represent workers and employers, and other stakeholders responsible for workers health and safety can help to improve mental health at work through action to:

        Prevent work-related mental health conditions
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        Preventing mental health conditions at work is about managing psychosocial risks in the workplace. WHO recommends employers do this by implementing organizational interventions that directly target working conditions and environments. Organizational interventions are those that assess, and then mitigate, modify or remove workplace risks to mental health. Organizational interventions include, for example, providing flexible working arrangements, or implementing frameworks to deal with violence and harassment at work.

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg">
        Protecting and promoting mental health at work is about strengthening capacities to recognize and act on mental health conditions at work, particularly for persons responsible for the supervision of others, such as managers.

        People living with mental health conditions have a right to participate in work fully and fairly. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides an international agreement for promoting the rights of people with disabilities (including psychosocial disabilities), including at work. WHO recommends three interventions to support people with mental health conditions gain, sustain and participate in work:

They may include giving individual workers flexible working hours, extra time to complete tasks, modified assignments to reduce stress, time off for health appointments or regular supportive meetings with supervisors.</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Return-to-work programmes combine work-directed care (like reasonable accommodations or phased re-entry to work) with ongoing clinical care to support workers in meaningfully returning to work after an absence associated with mental health conditions, while also reducing mental health symptoms.</li>
        <li class="text-gray-700 text-lg">Supported employment initiatives help people with severe mental health conditions to get into paid work and maintain their time on work through continue to provide mental health and vocational support.</li>
